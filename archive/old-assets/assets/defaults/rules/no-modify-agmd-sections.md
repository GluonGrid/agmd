# Rule: Preserve agmd-Managed Sections

## Important: agmd Section Protection

When working with `AGENTS.md` files:

### ✅ YOU MAY:
- Add content to sections marked with `<!-- agmd:custom-start -->` and `<!-- agmd:custom-end -->`
- Edit any content outside of `<!-- agmd:managed-start -->` and `<!-- agmd:managed-end -->` markers
- Suggest additions to rules/workflows/guidelines via agmd CLI

### ❌ YOU MUST NOT:
- Modify content between `<!-- agmd:managed-start -->` and `<!-- agmd:managed-end -->` markers
- Remove agmd comment markers (`<!-- agmd:... -->`)
- Directly edit the Rules, Workflows, or Guidelines sections if they're within managed markers

### Why?

These sections are automatically generated by the `agmd` CLI tool. Manual modifications will be:
- Overwritten on next `agmd generate`
- Lost when rules are updated
- Cause inconsistencies with the registry

### Instead, Use agmd CLI:

```bash
# Add a new rule to the registry
agmd new rule my-rule "Rule content here"

# Activate it in the project
agmd add rule my-rule

# Regenerate AGENTS.md (happens automatically)
agmd generate
```

### Custom Content

Add project-specific notes in the custom section:

```markdown
<!-- agmd:custom-start -->
## Project-Specific Notes

Your custom content here is safe and won't be overwritten.

<!-- agmd:custom-end -->
```
